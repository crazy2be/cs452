% TODO: we should do some asserting on task states in the kernel
Very little has changed with the architecture of the kernel since the previous assignment.

One change was to actually store the current state of a task in it's task descriptor.
Previously, the state of the task could be inferred, and did not need to be explicitly stored.
(If a task was currently being executed, it is active; if in the ready queue, it is ready; otherwise
it is a zombie. No other possible states existed.)
We now need to store whether a task is in the \texttt{REPLY\_BLK} or \texttt{RECV\_BLK} states,
since this cannot be inferred by whether the task is on some particular queue.

We also added a send queue attached to each task descriptor.
This is a FIFO queue which maintains a list of task descriptors which wish to send a message
to that task.
The FIFO queue was actually already implemented as a subproblem of the priority queue used
for the ready queue, and so very little new code needed to be written for this.

\section{Source Code}
The source code is hosted on git, at \url{git.uwaterloo.ca/pgraboud/cs452-kernel}.
The version we wish to submit is on the \texttt{k1} branch, specifically
the commit:
\input{|"git rev-parse k1 | ./../verbatim"}
We are submitting the following files:
\input{|"cat ../file-list | ./../verbatim"}
\input{|"./../file-list | ./../verbatim"}
